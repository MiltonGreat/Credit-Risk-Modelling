# Credit Risk Modelling

This repository shows the use cases for applying credit risk regulatory requirements to credit risk models. I used various datasets that involve credit risk assessment, loan defaults, and financial modeling. 

Here are some datasets that I am exploring and how I plan to apply my knowledge:

### 1. German Credit Data (Credit Risk)

**Dataset:** German Credit Data

**Description:** This dataset contains 1,000 samples of individuals with information about their credit, such as credit history, purpose, and current balance, and whether they defaulted on a loan or not (good/bad credit).

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[Probability of Default:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Probability-of-Default.git)** Built a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict whether an individual will default or not based on their features.
- **[Credit Scorecards:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Credit-Scorecard-Model.git)** Developed a credit scorecard model using features like "credit history," "purpose," and "savings" to assess the creditworthiness of an individual.
- **[Regulatory Implications:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Regulatory-Implications.git)** Implemented an IRB (Internal Ratings-Based) approach for calculating capital requirements for credit risk and simulate capital adequacy using the features in the dataset.
- **[Model Validation and Stress Testing:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Model-Validation-and-Stress-Testing.git)** Performed model validation (e.g., K-fold cross-validation, holdout validation) and stress-test the model under different economic scenarios (e.g., higher default rates).

### 2. Give Me Some Credit

**Dataset:** Give Me Some Credit

**Description:** This dataset contains information about customers’ credit history and default behavior. It includes information like credit usage, age, and income.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[Probability of Default:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Give-Me-Some-Credit-Probability-of-Default.git)** Used this dataset to build a binary classification model (good/bad credit) based on various features like credit utilization, monthly income, and loan amount.
- **[Retail Credit Risk Scorecard:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Retail-Credit-Risk-Scorecard.git)** Designed a credit scorecard model and evaluate the risk level of different customers based on their financial behavior.

### 3. Fannie Mae Single Family Loan Performance Data

**Dataset:** Fannie Mae Loan Data

**Description:** This dataset contains detailed loan performance information, including features like loan-to-value ratio, borrower’s credit score, and delinquency status.

**What I Did in the Project:**
- **Risk-Based Pricing Models:** Built models that calculate risk-based pricing for loans, where the interest rate is determined based on the credit risk of the borrower.
- **Delinquency Prediction:** Developed models that predict whether a borrower will default or become delinquent, helping improve the loan performance model.
- **Loan Valuation:** Implemented models for assessing the value of loan portfolios based on borrower behavior, credit risk, and macroeconomic factors.
